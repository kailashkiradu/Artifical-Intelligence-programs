## 8 Puzzle

The 8 Puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a 3x3 grid with numbered tiles. The goal is to move the tiles until they are in a specific goal state. This program implements an AI solution for solving the 8 Puzzle.

## 8 Queen Problem

The 8 Queen Problem involves placing eight queens on a chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This program provides an AI-based solution to this classic problem.

## Breadth-First Search (BFS) & Depth-First Search (DFS)

These programs implement the BFS and DFS algorithms for graph traversal. BFS explores nodes level by level, while DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

## Water Jug Problem

The Water Jug Problem involves measuring out a specific amount of water using two jugs of different capacities. This program uses AI techniques to find a solution to this problem.

## Tic-Tac-Toe

This program implements the Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent. The AI uses decision-making algorithms to play optimally against the player.

## A* Algorithm

The A* (A-star) Algorithm is a popular pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm used in many AI applications. This program demonstrates its use in finding the shortest path.

## Memory-Bounded A* Algorithm

This program implements a memory-bounded version of the A* algorithm, which is useful for solving problems where memory is a constraint.

## Min-Max Algorithm

The Min-Max Algorithm is used in decision-making and game theory for minimizing the possible loss in a worst-case scenario. This program applies the Min-Max algorithm to game-playing AI.

## Alpha-Beta Pruning

Alpha-Beta Pruning is an optimization technique for the Min-Max algorithm. It reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree. This program demonstrates its implementation.

## Mini Project - Chess

This mini project involves developing a Chess game with an AI opponent. The AI uses various algorithms to play against the user.

## Mini Project - Sudoku

This mini project implements a Sudoku solver using AI techniques. The solver can fill in the missing numbers in a Sudoku puzzle to complete it correctly.
